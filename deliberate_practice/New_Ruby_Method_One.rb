# arr.at method
#arr.at(0)

# Here we have an array
new_array = [12312, 123213, 45356, "abc", "random", 23232]


# here we access the array using the arr.at(ex) method

# puts new_array.at(3)

# This is successful, now we can play with it a little

# If we take the new_array method we can multiple it. However, it turns out this only concatenates the method. This is because the item is a string. so we cant multiply "abc" by "abc" as this is not an integer

# puts new_array.at(3) * 2

# So lets see how we would actually mutiple an item in the array... 

# puts new_array.at(2) * 2

# This works because the value of 2 in the array is an integer and can be multiplied.
